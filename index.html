        "Much of cognitive psychology involves gathering data from experimental participants. Gathering good data is not always easy, especially when one uses a variety of people as participants. Researchers often must carefully design an experiment to be certain that participants are following the instructions and are motivated to try their best. Even despite these efforts, experimental results can be contaminated by individual differences if the researcher does not properly analyze the data."+
        "<br><br>Press the right arrow key to proceed",
        "<b>Background (2/6)</b><br><br>" +
        "For example, consider two participants in visual detection of a faint target. The researcher wants to explore a property of the visual system, so he/she presents a visual stimulus and asks the participants to report whether they saw the target. After 50 trials, participant A reports seeing the target 25 times and participant B reports detection 17 times. Did participant A do better? Not necessarily, perhaps participant A is simply more prone to report seeing the target and participant B is more conservative. That is, the two participants may have equivalent visual systems, but differences in reporting. Reports of simple detection do not allow the researcher to compare participants' results." +
        "<br><br><b>[>]</b>",
        "<b>Background (3/6)</b><br><br>" +
        "A better experiment is a modification of the one above. Have two kinds of trials, one with the target present and one with the target absent. Again have subjects report whether they saw the target. There are four statistics to be calculated from this experiment. Trials in which a participant correctly detects the target are called hits. The trials in which the target was there but participants did not detect it are called misses. If a participant reports seeing the target when it was not actually there, he/she has made a mistake (false alarm). A trial in which the participant correctly reports that the target was not present is a correct rejection. " +
        "<br><br><b>[>]</b>",
        "<b>Background (4/6)</b><br><br>" +
        "Suppose that after 100 trials (50 for target present and 50 for target absent) the researcher again finds that on the trials in which the target was in fact present, participant A reports seeing it 25 times and participant B 17 times. Who is doing better? It depends on the frequency of false alarms. If participant A has 25 false alarms and participant B has 5 false alarms, then B is better than A at distinguishing the trials in which the target is present from the trials in which the target is absent. That is, in this case, A seems to often guess that the target is there, but he/she is wrong (false alarm) as often as right (hit). B is more selective about saying he/she detects the target, but rarely says the target is there when it is not. Thus, B is doing better." +
        "<br><br><b>[>]</b>",
        "<b>Background (5/6)</b><br><br>" +
        "This type of analysis suggests that you need to consider two numbers, hits and false alarms to really be able to compare performance across subjects. Fortunately, you can combine the numbers in a careful way to produce a single number that gives an indication of the sensitivity of the participant to the presence of the target. The calculation is structured so that, with certain assumptions, it will not matter whether a participant takes a conservative or liberal approach to claiming to detect the target. There are several measures of sensitivity, the most commonly used one being d' (d-prime), which is based on signal detection theory." +

        "A group of randomly placed dots (sort of like a \"star field\") will appear. The number of random dots varies from trial to trial. Also, on some trials (target present) an additional set of ten dots arranged in a straight line that slants downward from left to right is randomly placed among the dot field. On the other trials (target absent), the line is not included. Your task is to report whether the target is present or absent. During practice trials, you will have the chance to practice this a couple of times before you start the main task." +

In addition, on the trials in which the target was actually present, a green line will connect the target dots after you make your decision. Look for the dots along this line so you will learn what the target looks like but the target will be randomly placed on the screen from trial to trial. There are a total of 60 trials, twenty trials for each number of random dots. Half of the trials have the target present, while the target is absent on the other half of the trials." +
